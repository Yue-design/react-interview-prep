My understanding about React

## Why React?

1. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
2. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
3. Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
4. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
5. We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
6. React can also render on th server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Tasks

1. props in a child component
2. state with Hooks
3. state with inline conditional
4. react lifecycle methods

## What are the advantages of React16?

1. Better Error Handling (Error Boundaries)
2. New render return types: fragments and strings (as well as string and numbers)
3. Portals
4. Better Server-Side Rendering (Asynchronous Rendering)
5. Support for custom DOM attributes
6. Reduced File Size (concurrency, returning null from setState)
7. New Core Architecture (Component Stack Traces)
8. Browser Compatibility(Fiber) and MIT licensed

## Practice

1. React.memo()
2. React.lazy()
3. static contextType

## Disadvantages in React16

## React v17.0

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`
